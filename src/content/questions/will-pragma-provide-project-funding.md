title: Will PRAGMA provide project funding?
---

No. PRAGMA is not geared to be a funding vehicle; its purpose is to be an
umbrella organisation for open source development efforts.

PRAGMA will not receive, administer or deploy funding from members or third
parties for projects, nor will PRAGMA provide direct funding to maintainer
committees, maintainer committee members, or contributors.

This means that PRAGMA projects will need to look for other sources of
resourcing, which we believe is paramount for the long-term success of the
association.
